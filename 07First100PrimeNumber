Algorithm that print the first 100 Prime number:

N = Number
C = Count


Input:
N = Input;
i = 2;
C = 0;


Process:

for c <= 100;
  If N > 1: 
        if N >= i and N % i =! 0;
          for N = i++ and  N % i =! 0;
             Print "N is a Prime number."
          C++;
        else:
              print "N is NOT a Prime number."
  else:
    Print "N is not a Prime number as Prime number is an integer number greater than 1"
