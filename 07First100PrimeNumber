Algorithm that print the first 100 Prime number:

N = Number
C = Count


Input:
N = Input;
i = 2;
C = 0;


Process:

for c <= 100;
  If N > 1: 
    if N >= i and N % i =! 0;
      Print "N is a Prime number."
      C++;
      i++;
    else:
      N / i:
        if N % i == 0;
          print "N is NOT a Prime number."
        else:
          i++ 	
  else:
    Print "N is not a Prime number as Prime number is an integer number greater than 1"
