Open the trunk of your car.
Take out the wrench, jack and spare tire.
Place the Jack under your car.
Lock the lever of the jack in the hole of the jack.
Keep the lever with you left hand and rotate the lever with your right hand.
Jack-up the car as much as the flat tire is loose.
Pick the wrench and use it to unscrew all the lug nuts.
Once all the lug nuts are loose and out, pull the flat tire as much as you can to take it off.
Put on the spare tire.
Pick the wrench again and screw all the lug nuts as tight as you can.
Use the jack and lever again but this time rotate to the exact opposite direction to lower the car.
Put the jack and wrench right at their same place and replace the flat tire in the trunk.
Close the truck of your car, voila, you're good to go!
